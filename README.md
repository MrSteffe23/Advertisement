# Advertisement

I made this project for the VHDL class.   
I worked with **VHDL language** in **Vivado** in order to create an advertisement which had to appear on the *seven segment display from the FPGA Basys3 board*.   
The advertisement have **multiple functionalities** - 6 in total:   
- it can go from ***left to right in 2 ways***
- it can go from ***right to left in 2 ways***
- it can ***stand***
- it can ***flicker***   

The user can control these modes from switches.   

The challenge with this project was to figure out how to use the board and Vivado environment. In the end, it was a great experience and the
final product was pretty awesome and interesting.
